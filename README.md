# gameboy-js
Gameboy emulator. Work in progress

Built during winter nights of 2021 listening to vaporwave and mainly this [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVtvv3UH9LQ).

To run, first install npm dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

then create a local server and visit `localhost:8080`:

```
$ npm run serve
```

Roadmap:
- [ ] Improve the code quality and build system
- [ ] Make a presentable component out of this
- [ ] Finish the APU
- [ ] Support more Cartridge types
- [ ] Chill & Play, maybe make a blog post about it
