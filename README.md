# gameboy-js

Gameboy emulator. Work in progress

Built during winter nights of 2021 listening to vaporwave and mainly this [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVtvv3UH9LQ).

To run, first install npm dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

then create a local server and visit `localhost:8080`:

```
$ npm run vite
```

Roadmap:

- [x] Improve the code quality and build system
  - [x] Vite
  - [x] Prettier
  - [x] ES6 modules
  - [ ] Code quality: It looks better, but needs a lot of work ... Maybe in another life
- [ ] Finish the APU
- [ ] Support more Cartridge types
- [ ] Make a presentable component out of this
- [ ] Chill & Play, maybe make a blog post about it

Issues:

- [ ] Continue running test suites, haven't looked much into timing/interrupts
